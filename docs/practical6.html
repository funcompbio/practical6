<h1 id="objectives">Objectives</h1>
<p>This practical has been developed in collaboration with Dr. Javier Macia to strengthen some of the concepts and methods developed in the Mathematics subject, jointly with FCB. The learning objectives for this practical are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement in Python the SIR model of spreading infectious diseases.</li>
<li>Parametrize the Python implementation from the command line.</li>
<li>Use the implemented model to explore effect of different parameters.</li>
<li>Make syntax errors in Python.</li>
<li>Correct syntax errors in Python.</li>
<li>Debug your program when it doesn’t work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever you are stuck with an error, please consult the section entitled “Debugging” from <a href="/practical4#debugging/">practical 4</a>.</p>
<h1 id="setup-and-background">Setup and background</h1>
<p>To do this practical you need an installation of Python version 3. You can find the instructions in the <a href="/setup/">setup</a> link on how to install Python version 3 in your system. Once Python is installed, you should be able to call it from the shell in the terminal window. You can check whether that is possible by typing:</p>
<pre><code>$ which python
$ python --version</code></pre>
<p>It may happen that you have two Python installations, one corresponding to version 2.x and another to version 3.x. In that situation the previous command may say that your Python version is 2.x and to access the version 3 you need to call the executable <code>python3</code>. Try then for instance:</p>
<pre><code>$ python3 --version</code></pre>
<p>If this is your case, then whenever the executable <code>python</code> is invoked in the rest of this practical, please use <code>python3</code> instead.</p>
<p>We will be also using the Python libraries <em>numpy</em>, <em>pandas</em> and <em>matplotlib</em>. To install them type on the command line the following instructions:</p>
<pre><code>$ pip install numpy
$ pip install pandas
$ pip install matplotlib</code></pre>
<p>If your Python 3.x installation is available through the <code>python3</code> command, replace the <code>pip</code> executable by <code>pip3</code>.</p>
<h1 id="the-differential-equation-for-a-simplified-sir-model">The differential equation for a simplified SIR model</h1>
<p>A simplified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology">SIR model</a> of spreading an infection can be described with the following ordinary differential equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:sir}
    \frac{dI}{dt}=\rho\cdot I \cdot (1 - I) - \alpha \cdot I
  \end{equation} \]</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is the fraction (<span class="math inline">\(0\leq I\leq 1\)</span>) of infected population. We split the entire population in two fractions, infected (<span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>) and uninfected (<span class="math inline">\(1-I\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is the average number of people who will get infected with a contagious disease from one person with that disease, also known as <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number">basic reproduction number</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the average number of people who recovers from the disease.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Implement a script in Python called <code>sir.py</code> that takes the two previous terms <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> as arguments in the command line and prints the calculation for <span class="math inline">\(dI/dt\)</span> using Equation <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:sir}\)</span> and a fixed value of <span class="math inline">\(I=0.1\)</span>. Because the <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> arguments are non-integer values, you will need to coerce them from character string to the Python data type <em>float</em> using the function <code>float()</code> instead of the function <code>int()</code> that you would normally use for integer values.</p>
<p>For instance, the following call should give <code>0.045</code> as a result when calling this script with <span class="math inline">\(\rho=1.5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.9\)</span>.</p>
<pre><code>$ python sir.py 1.5 0.9
0.045</code></pre>
<p>Moreover, when the script is called without arguments or with the wrong number of arguments, the following message should be shown:</p>
<pre><code>$ python sir.py 
error: sir.py &lt;rho&gt; &lt;alpha&gt;</code></pre>
<h1 id="solving-a-ordinary-differential-equation-with-the-euler-method">Solving a ordinary differential equation with the Euler method</h1>
<p>A simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cx}
\frac{dX}{dt} = c\cdot X
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> changes with <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is some constant value, it can be analytically solved by moving terms and integrating separately both sides of the equality as follows (see a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_integrals">list of integrals</a>)</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \begin{eqnarray}
   \frac{1}{X}\cdot dX &amp; = &amp; c\cdot dt \nonumber \\
   ln(X) &amp; = &amp; c\cdot t \nonumber \\
   X &amp; = &amp; e^{ct} \label{eq:ect}
   \end{eqnarray} \]</span></p>
<p>However, such an exact solution often does not exist and we need to rely on numerical integration methods to find an approximate solution. The simplest of such methods is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">Euler’s method</a>, which is based on calculating the slope of the tangent line to the curve corresponding to the differential equation that we want to approximate.</p>

<p>Given a generic (first-order) ODE of the form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \frac{dX}{dt} = f(t, X) \]</span></p>
<p>and equally-spaced time points</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \begin{equation}
     t = \{t_0, t_1, ..., t_n\} \nonumber
   \end{equation} \]</span> so that for any two given time points</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \begin{equation}
     h =  t_i - t_{i-1} \nonumber
   \end{equation} \]</span> the Euler’s method approximates the next value of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> using the following recurrence</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \begin{eqnarray}
     X_1 &amp; = &amp; X_0 + h\cdot f(t_0, X_0) \nonumber \\
     X_2 &amp; = &amp; X_1 + h\cdot f(t_1, X_1) \nonumber \\
     X_3 &amp; = &amp; X_2 + h\cdot f(t_2, X_2) \nonumber \\
     \vdots &amp; = &amp; \vdots \nonumber \\
     X_n &amp; = &amp; X_{n-1} + h\cdot f(t_{n-1}, X_{n-1}) \nonumber 
   \end{eqnarray} \]</span></p>
<p>for some initial (condition) value <span class="math inline">\(X_0\)</span>. This can be compactly written using the following recurrence formula</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \begin{eqnarray}
     X_i &amp; = &amp; X_{i-1} + h\cdot f(t_{i-1}, X_{i-1})
   \end{eqnarray} \]</span></p>
<p>We are going to illustrate the Euler’s method by implementing it in Python for the previous example Equation <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:cx}\)</span>. In a file called <code>euler.py</code> enter the following code:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np

## ODE that we want to integrate
def f(X, c) :
    dX = c*X
    return(dX)

## Euler&#39;s method for numerical integration of the f() function
def euler(X0, c, t) :
    X = np.zeros(len(t))
    X[0] = X0
    h = t[1] - t[0]
    i = 0
    while (i &lt; (len(t)-1)) :
        X[i+1] = X[i] + h * f(X[i], c)
        i = i + 1

    return(X)

## set time points between 0 and 2 in steps (h) of 0.1
t = np.arange(0, 2, 0.1)

## initial value
X0 = 1

## constant for dX = c X
c = 2

## integrate dX = c X with Euler&#39;s method
X = euler(X0, c, t)

## print resulting values for each time point
print(&quot;t,dX&quot;)
i = 0
while (i &lt; len(X)) :
    print(&quot;%.3f,%.3f&quot; %(t[i], X[i]))
    i = i + 1</code></pre>
<p>This Python script approximates the solution for the ODE <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:cx}\)</span> using an initial value <span class="math inline">\(X_0=1\)</span>, a constant <span class="math inline">\(c=2\)</span> and equally spaced time points of size <span class="math inline">\(h=0.1\)</span> between <span class="math inline">\(t_0=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_n=2\)</span>. Run it in the following way from the Unix shell to store the results in a file called <code>ode2xh01.csv</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ python euler.py &gt; ode2xh01.csv
$ head ode2xh01.csv 
t,dX
0.00,1.00
0.10,1.20
0.20,1.44
0.30,1.73
0.40,2.07
0.50,2.49
0.60,2.99
0.70,3.58</code></pre>
<p>Now, let’s visualize the calculated curve next to the exact solution from Equation <span class="math inline">\(eqref{eq:ect}\)</span> by running the Python interpreter and interactively typing the following instructions:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np
&gt;&gt;&gt; import pandas as pd
&gt;&gt;&gt; import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
&gt;&gt;&gt; ode2xh01 = pd.read_csv(&quot;ode2xh01.csv&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; plt.plot(ode2xh01[&#39;t&#39;], ode2xh01[&#39;dX&#39;], &#39;-bo&#39;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; plt.plot(ode2xh01[&#39;t&#39;], np.exp(2*ode2xh01[&#39;t&#39;]), &#39;-ro&#39;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; plt.show()</code></pre>
<p>The last three instructions are the ones to plot the results using the Python library <a href="https://matplotlib.org">matplotlib</a>, where the first two prepare the plotting layout and graphical parameters and the third one executes de plot on the screen. While this is happening the Python prompt will be waiting for the plotting window to close. Therefore, to continue using the Python interpreter you need to close the plotting window first.</p>
<p>The resulting plot should look like this one below, where the red line corresponds to the exact solution and the blue line with dots to the approximate solution obtained by doing numerical integration with the Euler’s method.</p>
<p><img src="dXEuler.png" /></p>
<p>Change the size of the steps (<span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>) from 0.1 to a smaller size such as 0.05, calculate the approximate curve again and plot it next to the exact curve. Is this new approximation better or worse than the previous one? Could you think about why?</p>
<h1 id="solving-the-simplified-sir-model">Solving the simplified SIR model</h1>
<p>Finally, we are going to solve the simplified SIR model of Equation  by taking the code in <code>euler.py</code> and integrating it into our script <code>sir.py</code>. As part of this integration, please set the initial value of I at <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> to <code>0.001</code> and the time points from <span class="math inline">\(t_0=0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(t_n=30\)</span> in steps of <span class="math inline">\(h=1\)</span> unit.</p>
<p>Please also pay attention to the following points:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>What should be the function <code>f()</code> from the <code>euler.py</code> script?</p></li>
<li><p>What arguments should take now the function <code>euler()</code>? Should the code of this function change?</p></li>
<li><p>What should be doing the <code>main()</code> function in our script <code>sir.py</code>?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have done the intregation of the code, you should be able to call the script <code>sir.py</code> in an analogous way we were doing it with the script <code>euler.py</code>, redirecting the output to a CSV file and being able to change the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> in the command line. More concretely, please run the simulation with the following values of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\rho=1.5, \alpha=0.9\)</span>: Because <span class="math inline">\(\rho &gt; \alpha\)</span> the stable equilibrium point of <span class="math inline">\(I^*\)</span> should be at <span class="math inline">\(1-\alpha/\rho\)</span>, does it match? The plot should be similar to this one below.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="sirrho15alpha09.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\rho=1.5, \alpha=1.9\)</span>: Because <span class="math inline">\(\rho &lt; \alpha\)</span> the stable equilibrium point of <span class="math inline">\(I^*\)</span> should be at 0, does it match? The plot should be similar to this one below.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="sirrho15alpha19.png" /></p>
<p>Play with different values of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> to gain understanding on the dynamics of this simplified SIR model. A straightforward extension of the script would be to parametrize in command line the initial condition <span class="math inline">\(I_0\)</span> and the time points. A simple approach to parametrize the latter would be to assume a fixed starting time point and take the maximum time point <span class="math inline">\(t_n\)</span> and the step in time difference <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. You could also consider some default values for these additional parameters and that they would be <em>optional</em> for the user.</p>
